# 🧪 Beta Flow Test Plan

## 🎯 Semi-Automated Beta Signup Flow

After deployment, here's how to test the new automated email system:

### 📝 **Test Steps:**

1. **Go to your beta signup form** 
   - Visit: https://nixbit.dev/beta-signup.html (or your production URL)

2. **Fill out the form with test data:**
   ```
   Email: test.beta@example.com (or your personal email)
   Name: Test User
   Company: Test Company
   Role: Senior Developer  
   Team Size: 6-15 developers
   CI/CD System: GitHub Actions
   Motivation: Testing the beta flow automation
   Time Commitment: 1-2 hours
   Referral Source: Other
   ```

3. **Submit the form**

4. **Check for immediate effects:**
   - ✅ Success message should say: "Welcome to the Nixbit Beta Program! Check your email for next steps."
   - ✅ Form should be replaced with success screen

### 📧 **Expected Email Flow:**

#### **Email 1: Beta Welcome (to applicant)**
- **To:** test.beta@example.com 
- **Subject:** 🎉 Welcome to Nixbit Beta Program!
- **Content:** 
  - Personal welcome with applicant details
  - Clear next steps and timeline
  - Beta program benefits
  - Your contact information (scott@nixbit.dev)

#### **Email 2: Admin Notification (to you)**  
- **To:** scott@nixbit.dev
- **Subject:** 🚨 New Beta Program Signup
- **Content:**
  - Complete applicant details
  - Their motivation
  - Link to admin dashboard
  - Suggested next steps

### 🎛️ **Admin Dashboard Check:**

5. **Login to admin dashboard**
   - Go to: https://nixbit.dev/admin/beta-management 
   - Login with: admin@nixbit.dev / [your secure password]

6. **Verify beta management shows new applicant:**
   - Should show "Test User" in pending status
   - All form data should be displayed
   - Notes field should contain role, CI/CD, time commitment

### 🔧 **If Something Doesn't Work:**

#### **No Emails Received:**
- Check Netlify Function logs
- Verify `SENDGRID_API_KEY` environment variable is set
- Check email spam folder

#### **Emails Not Sending:**
- Check console logs in browser Network tab
- Verify email function deployment is successful  
- Test email function directly via Postman

#### **Admin Dashboard Empty:**
- Refresh the page (beta admin fetches data on load)
- Check Network tab for API call to marketing-signup
- Verify marketing-signup GET endpoint is working

### 📋 **Manual Process (Your Part):**

After receiving the admin notification email:

1. **Review applicant** in admin dashboard
2. **Create demo account** using existing credentials:
   - scott@nixbit.dev / demo1234 (for them to test)
3. **Send personal email** with:
   ```
