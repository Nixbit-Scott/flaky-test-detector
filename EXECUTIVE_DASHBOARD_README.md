### Interpreting Metrics

#### Cost Impact
- **High Impact** ($5,000+/month): Critical priority for immediate action
- **Medium Impact** ($2,000-$5,000/month): Should be addressed in current sprint
- **Low Impact** (<$2,000/month): Can be planned for future sprints

#### Risk Levels
- **Critical**: >10 flaky tests or >$5,000 monthly impact
- **High**: 6-10 flaky tests or $2,000-$5,000 monthly impact
- **Medium**: 3-5 flaky tests or $500-$2,000 monthly impact
- **Low**: <3 flaky tests or <$500 monthly impact

#### Stability Scores
- **Excellent** (90-100): Highly reliable test suite
- **Good** (80-89): Generally stable with minor issues
- **Fair** (70-79): Needs attention and improvement
- **Poor** (<70): Critical reliability issues
