- **Prisma ORM** with PostgreSQL for data persistence
- **JWT Authentication** with role-based access control
- **Comprehensive Audit Logging** for compliance
- **Real-time Metrics** collection and reporting

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- npm 8+
- Access to the backend API
- System administrator privileges

### Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Type checking
npm run typecheck

# Linting
npm run lint
```

### Environment Configuration

The admin dashboard connects to the backend API at `/api`. In development, Vite proxies requests to `http://localhost:3001`.

### Access Requirements

To access the admin dashboard:
1. You must have a user account with `isSystemAdmin: true`
2. The backend must be running with admin API endpoints enabled
3. Valid JWT token with admin privileges

### Key Components

#### Authentication System
- **AuthContext**: Manages admin authentication state
- **ProtectedRoute**: Ensures only system admins can access routes
- **JWT Handling**: Automatic token refresh and expiration handling

#### Dashboard Features
- **Real-time Metrics**: Auto-refreshing platform statistics
- **Activity Feed**: Live stream of platform events
- **Health Monitoring**: System service status indicators
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly responsive layout

### API Integration

The dashboard integrates with these admin API endpoints:

- `GET /api/admin/overview` - Platform overview statistics
- `GET /api/admin/metrics` - Platform performance metrics
- `GET /api/admin/organizations` - Organization management
- `GET /api/admin/users` - User management
- `GET /api/admin/health` - System health status
- `GET /api/admin/audit-logs` - Audit trail

### Security Features

1. **Role-based Access Control**: Only users with `isSystemAdmin: true` can access
2. **JWT Token Validation**: Automatic token verification and refresh
3. **Audit Logging**: All admin actions are logged for compliance
4. **Session Management**: Secure session handling with automatic logout
5. **CSRF Protection**: Built-in protection against cross-site request forgery

## Deployment

### Development
```bash
# Start admin dashboard in development mode
npm run dev:admin

# Start all services (backend + frontend + admin)
npm run dev:all
```

### Production Build
```bash
# Build the admin dashboard
npm run build:admin

# Build all applications
npm run build
```

### Environment Variables

No additional environment variables required - the dashboard uses the same backend API configuration as the main application.

## Monitoring and Observability

### Metrics Tracked
- Total organizations and active users
- Test execution statistics
- Monthly recurring revenue (MRR)
- System uptime and performance
- Customer health scores

### Real-time Features
- Live activity feed with platform events
- Auto-refreshing dashboard metrics
- System health status indicators
- Performance monitoring alerts

## Security Considerations

1. **Admin-Only Access**: Restricted to system administrators only
2. **Audit Trail**: Complete logging of all administrative actions
3. **Secure Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with role verification
4. **Data Protection**: Sensitive data handling with proper sanitization
5. **Rate Limiting**: Protection against abuse and DoS attacks
